  # Chat orchestration is implemented in Rust. The provider adapters are pinned,
  # self-contained executables, so Node/npm/Python remain build-time-only tools.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Three commands, and nothing else to start:

        atelier run              start everything and open the board
        atelier service install  have this computer start it at login
        atelier init             set the project in this folder up on it

      It answers your whole network, so the board opens on your phone —
      starting it prints the address to type there.

      The Chat tab and its provider adapters are bundled, so you need neither
      Node, npm, Python, nor a separately installed ACP adapter.

      Project tracking needs git and the Beads CLI (bd):
        https://github.com/gastownhall/beads

      None of these has to be on your PATH. Atelier looks there first, then in
      the ordinary places an installer writes to, which is how the copy started
      at login finds them with no shell behind it.
